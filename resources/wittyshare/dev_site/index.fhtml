<h2>Welcome to EUROFER, the European Steel Association</h2><p>Steel is one of the most attractive, most robust and most sustainable materials in the world. Thousands of different types of steel facilitate and improve our daily life in innumerable applications. Steel sets trends in lifestyle: it is the material of design and innovation in many aspects of our life, as for example in vehicles, building constructions, medical devices or household equipment. But steel does much more than that. Steel is 100 per cent recyclable and therefore contributes significantly to the long-term conservation of fundamental resources for future generations.</p><p>The European steel industry is a world leader in its sector with a turnover of about EUR 170 billion and direct employment of about 360 thousand highly skilled people, producing on average 190 million tonnes of steel per year. More than 500 steel production sites in 23 EU Member States provide direct and indirect employment and a living for millions of European citizens.</p>
