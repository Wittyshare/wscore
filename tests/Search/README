first run the script run.sh, which will copy the test directories to /tmp,
index this directory in the sqlite database file /tmp/testdb.sqlite, and
created the reverse index.
Once that's done, create the build directory, go in it, run cmake .. and the
make to get the executable.
before running you have to
  
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/mnogosearch/lib

build command :
mkdir build; cd build; cmake -DBOOST_PREFIX=/usr/local/boost_1_43_0 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..; make
