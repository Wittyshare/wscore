Creating a Search Module

Create a class that subclass WsAbstractSearch and redefine virtual functions.

The module must be compiled separatly and should be named 'WsModSearch'. The resulting so file will therefore be 'libwsmodsearch.so'

For the current SearchModule that uses MnoGoSearch, you should export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/mnogosearch/lib
