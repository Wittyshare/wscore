The file system tree daemon is a process that keeps the filesystem tree in memory, and answers requests sent by wt processes.
Communication is done with zeromq, and encoding of messages is done in JSON.
Possible requests are:
- get permission for a user on a path, to be used when displaying or sending a file
- get properties of a path, ie permission + all descriptions and metadata. Used when the metadata is needed

The messages exchanged are of the form
{ "type" : "perm"|"prop",
  "user" : "userid",
  "path" : "/path/to/doc"
}
or
{ "type" : "search",
  "query": "mnogo search query string"
}
Mnogosearch query params:
http://www.mnogosearch.org/doc33/msearch-doingsearch.html

Response messages are of the form
{ "perm" : "rw"|"ro"|"" }

 and

{ "perm" : "rw"|"ro"|"",
  "desc" : "blablabl",
  "groups": [ "groupname1", .....],
  "owner": "userid",
  "size" : "size"
}
or for search : 
{
	[ { "path" : "/path/to/result",
	    "excerpt" : "bla bla bla",
		"size" : "size of file",
		"description" : "bla bla bla"
	  }, 
	  .....
	]

}
