For the sort order based on the sort number:
The sort number is read by the parser and put into the properties.
Each time the FileSystemTree ends browsing a directory, (the endChild method is called), the FileSystemTree calls the sort() method of the current Node.
The sort method tests if the sort flag is set to true. If so, the fileVect and dirVect is sorted based on the sort number. The combinedVect is created and sorted also.
For intance
Node 1: 3
Node 2: -
Node 3: 2
Node 4: 4
Node 5: 1
The sorted vector will contain the Nodes is this order
[Node5, Node3, Node1, Node4, Node2]
