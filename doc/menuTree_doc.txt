The MenuTree class, builds the menu of a user based on a the FileSystemTree representing all the files on the server and a set of gids, which are the names of the groups where the user belongs.

The MenuTree class inherits from the TreeTraversal class that runs through the fileSystemTree and, for each Node found, it calls a virtual function overridden in the child class (MenuTree). The MenuTree class tests for each Node if the user is allowed to access it or no. If the user is allowed, a new Node is created whith the same Properties, but without any children. The new Node is added to the MenuTree. If the user does not have access, the Node and all its children are skipped.

The MenuTree class contains 3 overriden functions of the parent class which are:
	-beginTraverseDir
	-endTraverseDir
	-traverseFile

beginTraverseDir is called by the TreeTraversal each time a DirNode is found. It Creates the new Node with the properties, connects the current Node to this new Node and sets the new Node as the current Node.

endTraverseDir is called by the TreeTraversal each time the TreeTraversal finish to browse a DirNode and all its children. It sets the current Node as the Parent of the current Node.

traverseFile is called by the TreeTraversal each time a FileNode is found. it does the same things as beginTraverseDir but creates a FileNode instead of a dirNode. The current Node is not changed.

Requests to the filesystemtree are sent thanks to an abstractFsClient that allows multiple implementations (at time of writing: daemon and in object directly)
