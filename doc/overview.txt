# // Guy 2011-07-22 : TODO : Change lassie by nothing (/usr/local)
===== Compilation =====

Install libharu with this script:

  #!/bin/bash
  set -x
  
  sudo rm -Rf  /usr/local/include/hpdf
  sudo rm -Rf  /usr/local/lib/libhpdf*
  rm -Rf libharu/
    
  git clone git://github.com/kdeforche/libharu.git
  cd libharu
  git pull
  sed -i -e "s#install(FILES \${haru_HDRS} DESTINATION include)#install(FILES \${haru_HDRS} DESTINATION \${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR})#" CMakeLists.txt
  sed -i -e "s#install(FILES README CHANGES INSTALL DESTINATION .)#install(FILES README CHANGES INSTALL DESTINATION \${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR})#" CMakeLists.txt
  sed -i -e "s#install(DIRECTORY doc DESTINATION .)#install(DIRECTORY doc DESTINATION \${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR})#" CMakeLists.txt
  sed -i -e "s#install(DIRECTORY if DESTINATION .)#install(DIRECTORY if DESTINATION \${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR})#" CMakeLists.txt
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR=/usr/local/include/hpdf ../
  make
  make install

Checkout the repos common, gdcore and gdwtcore in $src.
Copy config to /etc/wt and edit accordingly the file 
First compile gdcore with this command, issue when in the gdcore directory:
   $src/common/autogenbase.sh
This will install the libraries in /usr/local/lassie.

Then go into the project's repository, and launch the script $src/common/autogenbase.sh 


In the CMake of the application, you need to include at the end of the file

For a web app:
  INCLUDE(../common/install_webapp.cmake) 
For a library:
  INCLUDE(../common/install_libs.cmake) 
For an application:
  INCLUDE(../common/install_progs.cmake) 

===== How it works =====

The structure of the content of the site is the structure of directories and files stored on disk from a base directory.
The content in the base directory is crawled by the DirCrawler, and it build a tree structure in memory (fileSystemTree). The hidden files are ignored. Directories are put in the tree with a DirNode object, files are put with a FileNode object.
A DirNode gives access to the properties of this directory. The properties of a directory are stored in the hidden file .properties in the directory itself. Recognized properties are, amongst others, in_menu, groups, ....
Some properties like groups are inherited by children nodes, others like in_menu are not. Inheritance of the groups by children means that to make a node unavailable to all, it is not possible to do it by setting an empty list of groups. The solution is to assign a group NO_ACCESS with no member.
A DirNode also gives access to its children nodes in 2 distinct lists: directory children list, and file children list.
