Each directory and file can have a config file.
For directories, the config file is named properties and located under the
.config subdirectory.
For files, the config file has the same name with the .json extension appended,
and is located under the .config subdirectory of its parent directory:

  base_dir
  +-about
    +-.config
      +-properties
      +-index.html.json
    +-index.html

Configuration directives common to files and directories are:
  - menu
    - in_menu : true/false: is the item displayed in the menu?

Configuration directives available for directories only are:
  - children
    - display_children_list: true/false
	- children_sort_criteria: string
	- children_sort_order: asc/desc
	- children_sort_list: hard-coded list of names (in the primary language).
  - i18n
    - iso locale code
	  - title
 
Configuration directives available only for file are:
  - i18n
    - id: identifier of the content element it is translating. See i18n.txt
	- locale: iso locale code this file gives the content for.
