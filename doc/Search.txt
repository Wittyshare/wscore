Documents are indexed by mnogosearch.
Document types indexed are PDF, fhtml, html.
PDF documents are converted to text by pdftotext, and html are natively handled
by mnogosearch.
fhtml and fragments of html documents and need a wrapper to be indexed by
mnogosearch because they are not full html documents. These fragments are the
content of a page.

The search class takes as constructor a FileSystemTree instance and a string
which is the query to perform.
First, all search results are loaded in the object by the load() method. Once
this is done, it is possible to retrieve the results available to a user or a
list of groups with the getResults method. This method returns a list of
ResultItems containing only documents readable by the groups (or the user)
passed as argument.

A ResultItem gives access to: 
  * the path of the document
  * the excerpt of the document containing the word.
  * the mime type of the document
  * the size of the document
